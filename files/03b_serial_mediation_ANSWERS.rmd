## Serial Mediation

![](serial-mediation.png)

In our serial mediation. There are an independent variable and a dependent variable, and two mediators. The two mediators do an increasingly better job at predicting the dependent variable. The schematic above depicts how it works. In everyday research, one should deduct this serial mediation model from theory or previous findings.

## Loading Libraries

We begin by loading the *lavaan* and *lavaanPlot* packages.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(lavaan)
library(lavaanPlot)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Loading Simulated data

**IV1** is food: *how much foot the cat intakes a day*

**M1** is weight: *how much the cat weighs*

**M2** is lazy: *how lazy the cat is*

**DV** is naps: *how much the cat sleeps*

**CV1** is cattitude: *how sassy the cat is*

**CV2** is temperature: *how hot it is*

*use read.csv() to load in the data*

```{r}
cat_nap <- read.csv("cat_naps.csv")
```

## Is there a relationship?

In general, you want to first establish that there is a significant direct effect of your IV on your DV. The hope is that when you run a mediation, adding in the mediator will partial out the significance of that direct effect. Meaning, the *why* cat naps increase is explained through food increasing weight, which increased laziness, which then in turn increases cat naps.

```{r}
  lm(dv ~ iv, cat_nap) %>%
  summary()
```

We do have a significant IV DV relationsip. Now, we will see if this effect becomes null when taking into account the mediators.

## Configuring the SEM for the serial mediation analysis

Now, we need to communicate our model configuration to Lavaan. Therefore, we create a new object, "model" in which we save the configuration.

```{r}
model <-
  '
  #Regressions
  m1 ~ a*iv
  m2 ~ b*m1 + iv
  dv ~ c*m2 + m1 + d*iv + cv1 + cv2
  
  #Defined Parameters:
  ie := a*b*c
  de := d
'
```

We first communicate the individual regressions.

Then, we define parameters within the SEM model using the `:=` operator.

We first define the **indirect effect** (ie) by multiplying the three coefficients a, b, and c. Those are the three coefficients that connect the IV to the DV via M1 and M2.

Then we extract the **direct effect**, which is simply the one coefficient d.

Using the following `sem()` command, we run the SEM. We then run the familiar "summary()" on the resulting object, which yields the below output.

```{r, cache = T}
fit <- sem(model, data = cat_nap, se = "bootstrap", bootstrap = 1000)
summary(fit, standardized = TRUE)
```

Finally, we use *lavaanPlot()* to visualize the serial mediation.

```{r}
lavaanPlot(model = fit, edge_options = list(color = "grey"), coefs = TRUE, sig = .05)
```

As in the model, you can see individual regressions presented in a pretty familiar way. The named/saved coefficients (a-d) are highlighted in brackets. At the very end, we see our defined parameters: We have our indirect effect and the direct effect. The convenient thing is that lavaan also tests the significance of our parameters.

The indirect effect (ie) is significant (b=.062, p\<.001), and the direct effect (de) is insignificant (b= -.001, p\>.05) - implying that the effect is fully mediated. We already knew this because I simulated it to be in this way.

## Reporting the serial mediation as a SEM

*Food intake had a significant positive effect on cat naps (b=.07, t(998) = 3.48, p\<.001). As theorized, this effect was serially mediated by weight and laziness. The indirect pathway of the effect of food intake on cat naps via weight and laziness was significant (b[indirect]= .062, p\<.001). This pathways fully accounted for the overall impact of food intake on cat naps with the direct effect becoming insignificant (bdirect= -.001, p\>.05).*
